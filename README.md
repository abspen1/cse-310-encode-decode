# Encode/Decode Program for CSE 310 @ ASU
This is a program that will take std::in input and output to std::out. However both can be redirected from/to txt files. Pretty fun program to build overall.

## Things To Do
* Tweak quick sort to sort pointer to string in encode.cpp similar to decode.cpp
* Ensure encode and decode are working perfectly on all large txt files within general.asu server
* Do more research
    * Add where the encode reads in multiple lines at once instead of just 1
